# Ninja Ghost 
Ninja Ghost is a game that is set in an environment of a war in the afterlife, which is something similar to a type of limbo to those who have experienced immense torture and hardships in life, and in order to reincarnate or being passed on, they have to complete something big. The alternative world is set in the late 1500s in Feudal Japan where the battle between the yamabushi or ninja happened.

Siobhan, who died in the real world due to a kidnapping gone wrong, was then reincarnated into the lands of Japan and was taken into refuge by then Warlord Oda Nobunaga. Siobhan was surprised to know that he knew how to speak in Japanese fluently, so he had no problem in conversing with the Japanese. Since it was difficult for the Japanese to say Siobhan as it was an Irish name, Warlord Oda gave the name Hibiki to him. Hibiki meant “Sound” in Japanese and Oda gave this name to him as he noticed Siobhan’s ability to walk without making any sound. In exchange for giving him food and shelter, Oda asked the newly named Hibiki to enroll himself in the training to become a ninja and help the warlord in unifying central Japan

However, Hibiki was confused as to how he even got here, considering he still had memories of the past life. He remembers how he lived in Ireland and what food he ate. Though, at present, everyone believes he is someone from the 1500s and is a full blood Japanese. His luck turned for the better as he found a Welsh person in the ninja training academy. As the two men saw each other, they immediately agreed to talk about what has been happening. It was through the information from the Welsh Ethan, Japanese name being Kage, that he knew what he had to do. He had to aid Warlord Oda in securing victory for Japan and that is the only way both Kage and Hibiki can be released from this world and will pass on. 

Within a few months, Hibiki rose through the ranks and became a Jonin thanks to his natural skills in assassinations, infiltrations, and sabotaging. It is then the Warlord Oda assigned important tasks to Hibiki to weaken the forces of Iga, the opposition. This is the chance for Hibiki to finally make progress in going away from this alternate world. 


# Level 1
Warlord Oda assigned HIbiki with looting the treasures and weaponry from the Iga strongholds. For this, Hibiki is provided a map of Maruyama Castle, a well-known stronghold where the warriors of Iga slept, ate and trained. The aim of Warlord Oda was to weaken the forces from within by starving them of food, weaponry and taking away their treasure which they used to trade for food. Hibiki is sent on the mission immediately.

# Level 2
Hibiki successfully brings back the necessary items. Upon inspection, Warlord Oda notices a scroll that details the important battle formations. It is said that the battle formations are inside a camp in the eastern side of Iga province. It also said that it is kept in the leader’s tent. Hibiki is given the next assignment to get the battle formation papers from the tent. Hibiki then marches onto his new mission.

-	Do plenty of platforming
-	Collect coins if they can
-	Create a distraction (can be done by going to an alarm, which can be triggered once the player reaches)

# Final Level
After Hibiki comes back with the papers, now it was time to plan their attack. The attack was planned by Warlord Oda, with about 40,000 warriors attacking the Iga province head on. The army needed to attack the province from the north, east and west. Hibiki was given the chance to infiltrate the main castle and fight the leader of the Iga warriors. Hibiki then makes his way through the castle to find the leader (boss) waiting in the study room.
# Gameplay
-	Any kind of hits can be done (jumping on the head, using arrows, using anything) Keypoint here is to increase the hitbox at first but then reduce the hitbox as the health goes
# Ending
After the Iga rebellion was ended, Warlord Oda thanked Hibiki and Kage for their efforts and their contribution to the war. It was then both of them felt very light and then noticed light shining on their bodies. It was time for them to go. As they said their final goodbyes, they dragged themselves to their tents and happily left the ninja body, as their soul rose from the body into the sky.
